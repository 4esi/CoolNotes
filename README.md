CoolNotes
Overview
I needed a simple, fast note-taking app, so I created CoolNotes - my very first own application.

In this project, I tried out the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for the first time and used the browserâ€™s localStorage to save data locally.

I didnâ€™t just copy code blindly; I made sure to understand how everything works. I asked ChatGPT for minimal help since I hadnâ€™t done a project like this before.

Features
Create and edit notes

List all saved notes

Select multiple notes to delete

Toggle Dark Mode in settings

Save notes in the browserâ€™s localStorage so data persists after reload

Technologies
JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML5

CSS3 (with custom theme switching)

LocalStorage API

I know this is not perfect and the code could be more efficient, but Iâ€™m doing my best to learn and improve.

Thanks for checking it out! ðŸ™‚
